# rpi_wordclock-websocket_client
Responsive website wich sends websocket commands to @bk1285's [rpi_wordclock](https://github.com/bk1285/rpi_wordclock).
!Attention: feature not implemented yet by @bk1285

By uncommenting 'host=hostIP' inside js/script.js and adding your wordclock ip, it is possible to control your wordclock without the need of an extra webserver.

Have fun!
